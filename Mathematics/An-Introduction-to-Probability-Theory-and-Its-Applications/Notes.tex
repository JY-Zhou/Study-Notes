	\subsection{The Empirical Background}
	\paragraph{Events} Events are the results of experiments or obervations.
	The events should be distinguished between \textit{compound(decomposable)} and \textit{simple(indecomposable) events}. A compound event is an aggregate of certain simple events.
	\paragraph{Sample points} Sample points are just the simple events. Every indecomposable result of the (idealized) experiment is represented by one, and only one, sample point.
	\paragraph{Sample Space} Sample space is the aggregate of all sample points.
	\section{Examples}
	\paragraph{Notes} 
	\begin{enumerate} 
	\item All intuitive background problems are abstractly equivalent to the scheme of placing \textit{r} balls into \textit{n} cells, in the sense that the outcomes differ only in their verbal description. \\There are some examples listed on P10.
